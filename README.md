# Data-Science-Jobs-Glassdoor
A guide to dataset cleaning and analysis using python libraries (pandas, regex, numpy, matplotlib)  

The dataset used was a very messy one and I used python libraries and defined functions to clean the dataset. This included steps like:  
-Removing duplicates  
-Handling nulls and outliers  
-Standardizing data formats  
-Extracting keywords  
-Replacing values and so much more  

The data visualizations were done with Matplotlib.  

The data was able to provide insight into the data scientist job postings on glassdoor, the most required skills, pay range as well as industries in the US with the most demand for data scientists.
